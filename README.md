# CloudkitSharedDemo


This repo contains a project that follows Doron Schwartz's excellent CloudKit tutorial, with a few modifications to bring the project up to Swift 5

The tutorial walks through the basics of Cloudkit: enable it in your app, make requests to a cloudkit container for a public/private/shared database, and CRUD your way to app success or error.
